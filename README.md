# Supermarket Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of supermarket customer behavior and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** segmentation. The analysis helps evaluate past campaigns, understand customer segments, and identify product preferences. By doing so, this project aims to optimize future marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to leverage RFM segmentation to:

- Analyze customer behavior.
- Evaluate marketing campaign performance.
- Optimize future campaigns based on customer segmentation and preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes anonymized transaction and campaign data from a supermarket. The data consists of:

- Customer transaction records (date, product, quantity, amount spent).
- Campaign performance (response rates, customer interactions).
- Customer demographics and segmentation.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicate records and handle missing values.
- Standardize date and numerical formats for consistency.

### 2. RFM Segmentation
We calculated the following for each customer:
- **Recency**: How recently the customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often the customer made a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much the customer has spent.

Based on these three factors, customers were grouped into segments such as *best customers*, *loyal customers*, and *at-risk customers*.

### 3. Campaign Performance Analysis
- Evaluated the success of each marketing campaign by analyzing response rates, purchase behavior post-campaign, and revenue generated.
- Identified which segments responded best to different types of campaigns (e.g., discounts, personalized offers).

### 4. Customer Segmentation
- Customers were segmented based on their RFM scores.
- Segments were analyzed to understand the characteristics of different customer groups, such as spending habits and campaign responsiveness.

### 5. Product Preference Analysis
- Analyzed the most popular products among different customer segments.
- Provided insights on which product categories performed best during campaigns.

## Insights

Some key findings from the analysis:
- **Loyal customers** tend to respond better to loyalty rewards programs, while **at-risk customers** respond well to flash sales or discounts.
- **Best customers** are more likely to purchase high-value products and respond to personalized marketing efforts.
- **RFM analysis** helps identify customer segments that require different strategies to boost retention and drive sales.

## Visualizations

Here are some visualizations from the analysis:

## Conclusion

This project shows that **RFM segmentation** is an effective tool for analyzing customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies. By understanding the behavior of different customer segments, supermarkets can tailor campaigns that maximize customer retention and drive revenue.

## Future Improvements

- Implement machine learning models to predict customer churn based on past behavior.
- Integrate additional demographic data to further refine customer segmentation.
- Explore A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing strategies on various customer segments.
